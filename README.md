**Background Information**
You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). The project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

It was established that:

- Most users visiting the ecommerce site are not new visitors 
- The month of May has the highest number of visits to the site, followed by November while February had the least number of visits. May however, does not result in a higher revenue as November does. It could be that more users make a lot of purchase to gift their loved ones over festivities such as Thanksgiving holiday, Christmas holiday, New year‚Äôs holiday
