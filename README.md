# Description
This is project consisted of four parts which entailed:

- Dimensionality reduction

- Feature selection

- Associative analysis

- Anomaly detection

**Background Information**
You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). The project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

It was established that:

- The most important features were: tax, cogs, gross income, quantity, unit price. These features can be used to build an ML model for predicting total price. 

- From PCA analysis: 5 components explain a higher percentage(73%) of variance. 

- The most frequent items are: tea, wheat, mineral, fat, yogurt
  - 100% of customers who bought “cookies and low” also bought “fat” or “yogurt”
  - 100% of customers who bought “burgers and whole” also bought “wheat”
  
- Anomalies were detected at sales greater than 1000

# Installations/ Setup requirements
Check out the six files in the repository😊
Each project has two files, .Rmd and its corresponding .pdf file
- To open the **Rmd** file, you will need to have R and R Studio installed to run the code chunks
- The .pdf files have saved outputs. You can directly open the .pdf file on a web browser or download it. To open the **.pdf** file, you will need to have a pdf document reader such as Adobe Acrobat Reader
